There, behind the third crossroads, and from there strictly to the south,
A horseman with a golden saber sows stars in the grass.
Do you hear? Clusters drops the sky from the holes steel grain,
Mountain dashing paths covering with a veil.

The roads intertwined into a tight ball of snakes in love,
And from the breath of volcanoes in the mists the wing goes numb...
Evil one, calm down! We are still stronger than you
And the lights of heavenly countries will be warm today.

There, at the third pier, a gray sail, a white sail,
Divide the sky from the beginning to dawn with a lacerated wound,
Do you hear? The sea washes scars, sprinkles coarse salt
Scabs the color of bull's blood, like a memory of ancient pain.

The roads intertwined into a tight ball of snakes in love,
And from the breath of volcanoes in the mists the wing goes numb...
Evil one, calm down! We are still stronger than you
And the lights of heavenly countries will be warm today.

There at the third threshold, behind a wide step,
True silk stones, the road breaks in two,
Do you hear? The right path leads to the pier,
The circuitous path is to the mountains, to the south, but there is no road in the world,
To lead us to each other!

The roads intertwined into a tight ball of snakes in love,
And from the breath of volcanoes in the mists the wing goes numb...
Evil one, calm down! We are still stronger than you
And the lights of heavenly countries will be warm today.

The roads intertwined into a tight ball of snakes in love,
And from the breath of volcanoes in the mists the wing goes numb...
Evil one, calm down! We are still stronger than you
And the lights of heavenly countries will be warm today.
